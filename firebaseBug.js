The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the app initialization is not handled correctly. For example, if the `initializeApp` function is called multiple times with different configurations, it might lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Another issue can arise from asynchronous operations where data from Firebase isn't fully loaded before the app attempts to use it, resulting in null pointer exceptions or undefined values.
